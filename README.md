Project: SaaS Business Metrics Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

Built an end-to-end SaaS analytics dashboard tracking MRR, churn rate, retention, ARPPU, active customers, and revenue at risk.

Wrote SQL queries using GROUP BY, JOINs, CASE WHEN, and date-based aggregations to calculate monthly churn, MRR, and customer retention.

Analyzed plan-wise performance (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) to identify higher churn in Pro plans and revenue concentration in Enterprise plans.

Designed interactive Power BI visuals (KPIs, line charts, bar charts, pie charts, slicers) to support business decision-making.

Delivered insights such as declining ARPPU trend and improving churn rate over time.
